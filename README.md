## Data

LTPP: https://infopave.fhwa.dot.gov/

1. what inputs do we need? 

**IRI<sub>0</sub>**  : The initial IRI, which is the IRI measured immediately after construction. This parameter denotes the quality of construction and was reported in many studies to significantly affect the progression of IRI with age.

## Model
pytorch



## Result
compare some models: RNN, LSTM, MLP
